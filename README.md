# Battleship
An old battleship game I created in 2019. Uploading here as an attempt to improve and revamp the game.

It was created in the IntelliJ Idea IDE alongside Gluon Scene Builder in the Java language, specifically JavaFX v11.0.5.

It utilizes Java sockets in order to allow two players on the same local network to play against one another using TCP ports. The program is split into two projects, a client and a server. Once the server is running, two identical versions of the client program can be ran simultaneously upon which the game starts. This can be done from one computer, or two computers that share the same network.
